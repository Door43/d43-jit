Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they all spoke the same language. But the people did not obey God. Instead of having children and filling the earth, they gathered together and built a city.

They were very proud, and they did not care about what God said. They even began building a tall tower to reach heaven. God saw that if they all kept working together, they could do many evil things.

So He changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, "Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you. I will bless you and make you a great nation. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All families on earth will be blessed because of you."

So Abram obeyed. He took his wife, Sarai, and all his servants and herds of animals and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan.

When Abram arrived in Canaan God said, "Look all around you. All the land that you can see I will give to you and your descendants as an inheritance. I will bless you and make your name great." Then Abram settled in the land.

One day, Abram met Melchizedek, the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.

Abram and Sarai waited over twenty years, but they still had no son. God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God’s promise. God said that Abram was righteous through believing in God's promise.

Then God made a covenant with Abram. A covenant is an agreement between two parties. God said, "I will give you a son from your own body. To your descendants I give the land of Canaan.” But Abram still had no son.
